    <h4 class="meal">Appetizers</h4>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p class="ingredients">
    3 strips bacon<br/>
    6 large mushrooms<br/>
    1 tablespoon butter<br/>
    1/2 onion, diced<br/>
    1 clove garlic, sliced<br/>
    3 ounces cream cheese<br/>
    3 ounces blue cheese<br/>
    1/3 cup bread crumbs<br/>
  </p>

  <h2>Step by Step Directions</h2>
  <p class="stepXstep">
    1.	Cook bacon strips in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy; drain on paper towels. While the bacon is cooking, remove stems from mushrooms. Set caps aside, and chop stems.<br />
    2.	Add butter to skillet with bacon grease. When melted, stir in mushroom stems, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently until the onions caramelize, 15 to 20 minutes.<br />
    3.	Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a small baking dish with cooking spray.<br />
    4.	Once the onion mixture has reached a deep, rich brown color, place into a blender along with bacon, cream cheese, blue cheese, and bread crumbs. Blend on low until ingredients are roughly chopped and evenly combined. Stuff cheese mixture into mushroom caps and place into prepared baking dish.<br />
    5.	Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.<br />

    <h4 class="meal">Dinner</h4>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p class="ingredients">

    1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta<br/>
    1/2 cup chopped red onion<br/>
    1 tablespoon olive oil<br/>
    2 cloves garlic, crushed<br/>
    1 pound skinless, boneless chicken<br/>
    breast meat - cut into bite-size pieces<br/>
    1 (14 ounce) can marinated artichoke<br/>
    hearts, drained and chopped<br/>
    1 large tomato, chopped<br/>
    1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese<br/>
    3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br/>
    2 tablespoons lemon juice<br/>
    2 teaspoons dried oregano<br/>
    salt and pepper to taste<br/>
    2 lemons, wedged, for garnish<br/>

  </p>

  <h2>Step by Step Directions</h2>
  <p class="stepXstep">

    1.	Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bit, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.<br />
    2.	Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 to 6 minutes.<br />
    3.	Reduce heat to medium-low; add artichoke hearts, tomato, feta cheese, parsley, lemon juice, oregano, and cooked pasta. Cook and stir until heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper, and garnish with lemon wedges.<br />

    <img src="http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/140x140/00/01/94/19427.jpg"/>

    <h4 class="meal">Breakfast</h4>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p class="ingredients">


      1 cup packed brown sugar<br />
      1/3 cup butter, melted<br />
      2 tablespoons light corn syrup<br />
      1/3 cup chopped pecans<br />
      12 (3/4 inch thick) slices French bread<br />
      1 teaspoon grated orange zest<br />
      1 cup fresh orange juice<br />
      1/2 cup 2% milk<br />
      3 tablespoons white sugar<br />
      1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />
      1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
      3 egg whites<br />
      2 eggs<br />
      1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for
      dusting<br />

    </p>

    <h2>Step by Step Directions</h2>
    <p class="stepXstep">


      1.	In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, melted butter, and corn syrup. Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, and spread evenly. Sprinkle pecans over the sugar mixture. Arrange the bread slices in the bottom of the dish so they are in a snug single layer.<br />
      2.	In a medium bowl, whisk together the orange zest, orange juice, milk, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, egg whites, and eggs. Pour this mixture over the bread, pressing on the bread slices to help absorb the liquid. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour, or overnight.<br />
      3.	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C ). Remove the cover from the baking dish, and let stand for 20 minutes at room temperature.<br />
      4.	Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.<br />
